## Profile

I am a linguist with two foreign languages skills (French and English) and I'm working as a translator. Last year I’ve graduated from university and decided to learn Web development as programming has been my passion for a long time as thought-provoking and extremely interesting field of activities. That's why I’d love that one day it became my major activity. As a bonus, programming is connected with linguistics (as languages are still dear to me), it opens new perspectives in understanding what language is, so my actual skills could be applicated as well. 

## Skills

* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript
* VS Code
* Git, GitHub

## Code example

```javascript, codewars kyu 7

function strCount(obj){
  let strings = 0;
  for (let i in obj) {

    if (typeof obj[i] == 'object') strings += strCount(obj[i]);

    if (typeof obj[i] == 'string') strings += 1;

  }
  return strings;
};
```
