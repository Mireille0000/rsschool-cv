            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>I am a linguist with two foreign languages skills (French and English) and I'm working as a translator. Last year I’ve graduated from university and decided to learn Web development as programming has been my passion for a long time as thought-provoking and extremely interesting field of activities. That's why I’d love that one day it became my major activity. As a bonus, programming is connected with linguistics (as languages are still dear to me), it opens new perspectives in understanding what language is, so my actual skills could be applicated as well. </p>
